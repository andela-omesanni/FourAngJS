DISCOVER PLACES IN LAGOS THROUGH FOUR SQUARE USING ANGULAR JS (7TH ANDELA PROJECT)

************************************************* DESCRIPTION ****************************************************

This project's functionality is the same as my sixth andela project. Basically like the sixth project, this project lets
you discover places in lagos through four square except it uses the AngulaJS.

************************************************* THINGS LEARNT **************************************************

This was my first time of using AngularJS so I learnt a lot. I learnt about scopes, controllers, directives, ng-models,
ng-shows, services and the whole shebang.
